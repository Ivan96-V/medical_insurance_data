# medical_insurance_data
This is an analysis I performed on a dataset from a CSV file with medical insurance data. This file has the following columns: age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region, and charge.
I performed an analysis of some of the variables to see if they have any relationship with the cost of insurance. It does not yet contain graphs, but they will be added, and more analyses will be added to determine how much they can change the cost of insurance.
